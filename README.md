# viseagenti_sustav_za_multilateralno_pregovaranje_termina_sastanka

A multilateral multi-agent program for the negotiation of meetings. 

To run the program you need to install python and SPADE.
It can be run using 2 options:

- ```python3 main.py```
- ```python3 main.py -preference```

The first option will run the program with generic options for negotiating a meeting, like date, time of meeting and the duration of the meeting. The second option also includes preference which allows the user agents to consider a preference function when determining if they will accept a meeting or decline it.
